Civic Liker is a movement to reward good content and encourage openness. The Civic Liker subscription plan provides a convenient way for supporters to sponsor creators by monthly subscription, and let the creators focus on their work with decent rewards. Readers can pay for at least the cost of a coffee, or up to the cost of a bottle of champagne, to support creators.

### **Monthly subscription fee for designated creators**

Civic Likers also has the prestige power to vote for the daily distribution of the Creator's Fund by clicking LikeCoin buttons on any creative works.
