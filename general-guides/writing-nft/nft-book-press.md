# Mint NFT Book

{% hint style="info" %}
Mint NFT requires the [Keplr Browser Extension](../wallet/keplr/) and LikeCoin on a desktop computer
{% endhint %}

Publishing an NFT book on the blockchain involves the following processes:

1. [Prepare the ePub File](nft-book-press.md#create-an-epub-file-and-enter-metadata)
2. [Register ISCN](nft-book-press.md#register-iscn)
3. [List the Book for Sale](nft-book-press.md#list-the-book-for-sale)

***

## Create an epub file and enter metadata

Create an ePub file and enter metadata. First, create the ePub file for the e-book, and ensure that the metadata has been entered and organized. Metadata includes book title, author, cover image, publication date, description, etc. Taking the commonly used ePub editing software as an example:

#### calibre

The "Edit Metadata" button is in the upper left corner of the screen. After organizing the metadata, click "Save to disk".

#### Sigil

In Sigil, you can press the F8 key to edit metadata on the fly.

## Register ISCN

After preparing the ePub file, register it as an ISCN.

### Step 1: Upload the file

Visit the[ app.like.co](https://app.like.co/) website and click "Register ISCN".

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 5.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Visit the app.like.co website and click "Register ISCN"</p></figcaption></figure>

A pop-up window will appear; click on Keplr to connect the wallet.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 6.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A pop-up window will appear; click on Keplr to connect the wallet</p></figcaption></figure>

Click "Select a file" to upload the prepared ePub file.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 7.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click "Select a file" to upload the prepared ePub file</p></figcaption></figure>

The system will automatically split the ePub file content into two files: one is the ePub file, and the other is the book cover image file. Check if everything is okay, then click "Start Upload". The system will upload these two files to the distributed network.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 8.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click "Start Upload" to upload the two files to the distributed network</p></figcaption></figure>

The Keplr wallet will pop up a window several times; click "Approve" to sign and wait for a while.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 9.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click "Approve" on Keplr to sign</p></figcaption></figure>

### Step 2: Enter book information

"File Ready" appears, indicating that the file has been successfully uploaded. Four URL Hashes appear, with each pair corresponding to one file, including IPFS and AR (Arweave) formats. Taking the attached screenshot as an example, the four hashes represent the IPFS ePub file, IPFS book cover file, AR ePub file, and AR book cover file. Click on the URLs to check whether the content has been successfully uploaded.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 10.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Upon successfully uploaded, Four URL Hashes appear</p></figcaption></figure>

Scroll down the page. Simultaneously, the system will automatically fill in the book title, description, author, etc., based on the metadata content. You can also add tags to books for classification. Then click "Same As URLs".

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 11.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click "Same As URLs"</p></figcaption></figure>

The system will identify the ePub file from one of the hash URLs. Click "Confirm" after confirming it is correct.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 12.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click "Confirm"</p></figcaption></figure>

Fill in the URL and ISBN fields if required; the Type is displayed as Book. You can select the appropriate License for copyright declaration; the default is "Copyright. All rights reserved". After confirming that everything is correct, click "Register".

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 13.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>After confirming that everything is correct, click "Register"</p></figcaption></figure>

The Keplr wallet will pop up a window several times; click "Approve" to sign. Be careful not to click "Retry"; just wait for a while.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 14.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click "Approve" on Keplr to sign</p></figcaption></figure>

### Step 3: ISCN registration completed

"Completed! Here is your ISCN" appears, indicating that the ISCN has been successfully registered. The string of characters in the ISCN ID field will be used when the NFT book is listed for sale. Note that the last number is the ISCN version number; you do not need to enter it when listing the NFT book.

## List the Book for Sale

Listing for sale is divided into two steps: minting the NFT book and listing it. An analogy to traditional publishing is printing manuscripts into books and placing them on bookshelves for sale.

### Step 1: Mint the NFT book

Visit the [LikeCoin NFT BookPress](https://likecoin.github.io/nft-book-press/) website, click "Mint NFT", enter the website, and click the "Connect Wallet" link in the upper right corner to connect with Keplr.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 16.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Visit the LikeCoin NFT BookPress website, click "Mint NFT"</p></figcaption></figure>

In the "Enter ISCN ID or NFT Class ID" field, enter the ISCN ID registered previously on app.like.co, and note that you do not need to enter the ISCN version number. Then click "Submit".

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 17.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>In the "Enter ISCN ID or NFT Class ID" field, enter the ISCN ID</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
If you forget your ISCN ID, you can retrieve it in "[My Works](https://app.like.co/works)" at app.like.co.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The system will automatically extract the basic information of ISCN for you. Click the "By filling required information" tab to continue.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 18.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click the "By filling required information" tab</p></figcaption></figure>

If your book file is in ePub format, the system will automatically extract the link to the AR cover and place it in the "Image URL" column. Enter the number of NFTs to mint in the "Number of NFT to mint" field. "External URL (optional)" and "URI (optional)" do not need to be filled in. After filling in and confirming that everything is correct, click "Mint". The Keplr wallet will pop up windows several times. Click "Approve" to sign.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 19.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Enter the number of NFTs to mint in the "Number of NFT to mint" field and click "Mint"</p></figcaption></figure>

The ðŸŽ‰ Success! screen appears, indicating that the NFT has been successfully minted. Click "Continue to publish NFT Book" to complete the listing. Click "View your NFT" to view minted NFT books in Liker Land.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 20.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>. Click "Continue to publish NFT Book" to complete the listing. Click "View your NFT" to view minted NFT books in Liker Land</p></figcaption></figure>

Since it is not yet available for sale, you will see the words "Sold Out".

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 21.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Since it is not yet available for sale, you will see the words "Sold Out"</p></figcaption></figure>

### Step 2: Book Listing

Return to LikeCoin NFT BookPress, click "Continue to publish NFT Book," and the NFT Book Store Management Page will appear.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you accidentally closed the page, you can enter your NFT Class ID in [Step 1](nft-book-press.md#register-iscn) "Enter ISCN ID or NFT Class ID," and you will see "Continue to publish NFT Book". The Class ID is the string after the URL of your NFT book. For example, your NFT URL is  https://liker.land/zh-Hant/nft/class/likenft1qq06n42guzvt087wxunaajvz3alx6wadq6mfz0yz57gffwsrgrasl2m59x, and the NFT Class ID is likenft1qq06n42guzvt087wxunaajvz3alx6wadq6mf z0yz57gffwsrgrasl2m59x.
{% endhint %}

The NFT Class ID and Total number of NFT for sale, which is the number of NFT books that have been minted, automatically appear in the "New NFT Book Listing".

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 22.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The NFT Class ID and Total number of NFT for sale automatically appear in the "New NFT Book Listing"</p></figcaption></figure>

Enter the following in "Pricing and Availability":

* Default display currency when user checkout: Pricing is USD or HKD.
* Price (USD) of this book (Minimal 0.9 or free): The minimum price is 0.9 USD, or enter 0 for free.&#x20;
* Total number of NFT for sale of this edition: Number of NFT books for sales for this edition. Note that the "Total number of NFT for sale" refers to the number of NFT books that have been minted, while the "Total number of NFT for sale of this edition" sets the sales quantity of this specific edition.
* Product name of this edition: You can set the version of NFT according to your personal preferences, such as Standard Edition, Free Edition, etc. Click "Add Edition" in the upper right corner to add multiple different versions.
* In "Product description of this edition", you can enter the Chinese and English description of the NFT book version.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 23.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Enter information into "Pricing and Availability"</p></figcaption></figure>

In addition, users can also set whether to sell Physical Goods, Connect to your own Stripe Account, and whether the PDF file of the specified NFT book can be downloaded ("Disable file download for PDF"). Then click "Submit".

The version of the book will appear in "Current Listing".

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 24.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The version of the book will appear in "Current Listing"</p></figcaption></figure>

Go back to Liker Land to check that the NFT book has been successfully listed for sale.
