# Transfer Writing NFT

You can transfer your favorite Writing NFTs to others.

Users can leave a message when gifting a Writing NFT to the recipient. The message is recorded as a transaction memo on the chain and can be stacked during further transfers, forming a “log” of that particular piece of Writing NFT.

Transferring Writing NFT is demonstrated as follows:

* Find the [NFT Class ID](collect-writing-nft/nft-details.md#nft-class-id) on the Writing NFT that will be distributed to supporters.
* Enter the NFT Class ID into the Send NFTs tool, and enter the supporters’ wallet addresses to the "Recipient Address list" and the "Transfer message", then press "Send" and sign in Keplr to batch send NFTs to supporters.

#### Method 2:

* In [LikeCoin ISCN/NFT Tools](https://likecoin.github.io/iscn-nft-tools/), select "[Send NFT](https://likecoin.github.io/iscn-nft-tools/send-nft)" and log in with Keplr.
* Prepare a CSV file ( see [example](https://github.com/likecoin/iscn-nft-tools/blob/master/send-nft/list\_example.csv) ) containing the wallet addresses, the [Class ID](collect-writing-nft/nft-details.md#nft-class-id)s of the NFTs to be sent, and the memos, which are the [transfer messages](transfer-writing-nft.md#step-2-enter-the-recipients-wallet-address-and-transfer-message). Then click "Send" and sign the transaction in Keplr to mass distribute the NFTs.
