# Transfer Writing NFT

You can transfer your favorite Writing NFTs to others.

Users can leave a message when gifting a Writing NFT to the recipient. The message is recorded as a transaction memo on the chain and can be stacked during further transfers, forming a “log” of that particular piece of Writing NFT.

Transferring Writing NFT is demonstrated as follows:

## Step 1: Login and transfer

Log in to your [Keplr Browser Extension](../wallet/keplr/), [Cosmostation Browser Extension](../wallet/cosmostation/), [Leap Browser Extension](../wallet/leap/), [Cosmostation app](../wallet/cosmostation-app/) or [Liker Land app](../../user-guide/liker-land/download.md). Then, click on the NFT that needs to be transferred and check how many of them you own. Click "Transfer".
