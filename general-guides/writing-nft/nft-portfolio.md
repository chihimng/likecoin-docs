# NFT Portfolio

Besides collecting via NFT Widget, readers can also collect Writing NFT from the writerâ€™s **NFT Portfolio** page ( Format https://liker.land/\[WalletAddress] ). Writers and Collectors can share the links of their collection by any channels.

Portfolio page lists all NFTs and their estimated values. It is the place where user can transfer NFT and sell them to the secondary market.

In addition to expressing the value of the collectibles in numbers, the Portfolio page further reflects the current price of Writing NFTs with gems of different grades. The color and shape of the gem on the work will change according to the market price, beautifying the Writing NFT display.
