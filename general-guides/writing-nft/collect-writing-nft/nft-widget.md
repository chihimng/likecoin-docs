# NFT Widget

Readers [collect Writing NFTs](./) by an extremely easy way.

Unlike popular NFT marketplaces such as Opensea that converge creators and buyers traffic into a centralized portal, the buyers of Writing NFT is actually **readers** that want to focus on reading. The buying process of readers that surfing on Internet should be hooked with the reading experience.

It works like a vending machine, showing the current price of this Writing NFT, and let readers to collect by a click if the price is right.
