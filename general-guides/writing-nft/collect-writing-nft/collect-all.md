# One-Click Collect All Writing NFT

Using the One-Click Collect All feature allows users to purchase all Writing NFTs from a single creator at once, with an automatic filtering feature to prevent duplicate purchases of previously acquired NFTs.

## Step 1: Login to your wallet and initiate One-Click Collect

Please log in to your [Keplr](../../wallet/keplr/), [Cosmostation](../../wallet/cosmostation/), [Leap](../../wallet/leap/), [Keplr mobile](../../wallet/keplr-mobile/), [Cosmostation app](../../wallet/cosmostation-app/cosmostation-app-deposit-and-send-likecoin.md) or [Liker Land app](../../../user-guide/liker-land/download.md). Then, on the creator's [Bookshelf](bookshelf.md), click "Collect All".

## Step 2: Check your backpack

The backpack page will appear. If you already own NFTs from the creator, the system will automatically exclude those owned NFTs and only display the ones you have not collected before. You can also click the "X" to remove any NFTs you don't wish to purchase.

Once you have finished checking, click "Checkout by LIKE" or "Checkout by card".

### Checkout by LIKE
