# NFT Portfolio

Besides collecting via the NFT Widget, readers can also collect Writing NFTs from the writer's **NFT Portfolio** page (in the format https://liker.land/\[WalletAddress]). Writers and collectors can share links to their collections through any channel.

## NFT Gems

In addition to expressing the value of the collectibles in numbers, the Portfolio page further reflects the current price of Writing NFTs with gems of different grades. The color and shape of the gem on the work will change according to the market price, beautifying the Writing NFT display.
