## Writing NFT secondary market

The LikeCoin [Writing NFT secondary market prototype](https://likecoin.github.io/likecoin-nft-marketplace/) was released, free trading of NFT is possible NOW! You can check out and buy NFTs, you can also find the latest buying and selling data.

The current secondary market interface is a minimal viable product to archive basic functions without any UX/UI design. Feel free to try it out and give us your feedback on the [LikeCoin Discord](https://discord.gg/likecoin).
