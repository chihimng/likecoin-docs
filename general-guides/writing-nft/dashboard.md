# My Dashboard

[**My Dashboard**](https://liker.land/dashboard) page lists all NFTs and their asset values. It is the place where users can transfer NFTs, sell them to the secondary market, and check out their top fans status.

## Feature and Hide

Users can organize their own portfolio by featuring or hiding NFT items (clicking the star on the top right hand corner). The featured NFT will be placed on top of the list, while the hidden NFT wonâ€™t be displayed in public view.
