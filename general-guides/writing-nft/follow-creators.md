# Follow Creators

Users can now follow a creator by providing their email address. Whenever the creator publishes an NFT, the followers will receive an email notification and will never miss the chance to collect.

## Step 1: Setup Email

After logging in to [Liker Land](https://liker.land/), click "[Settings](https://liker.land/en/settings/)", then click "[Email](https://liker.land/en/settings/email)".
