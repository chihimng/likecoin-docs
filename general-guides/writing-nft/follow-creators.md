# Follow Creators

Users can now follow a creator by providing their email address. Whenever the creator publishes an NFT, the followers will receive an email notification and will never miss the chance to collect.

## Method 1: Fill in your email and follow the creator directly

On the left-hand column of the creator's [NFT Portfolio](collect-writing-nft/nft-portfolio.md), enter your email address and click "Follow".
