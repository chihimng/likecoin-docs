## FAQ

### What is Writing NFT?

Writing NFT is the NFT of a piece of writing, literally. It can refer to articles or any type of textual content with or without illustrations.

### How to collect Writing NFT？

Collect in [NFT Widget](nft-widget.md) embedded in the content, or at the user’s [NFT Portfolio](nft-portfolio.md) page. Readers need to log into [Keplr Browser Extension](../wallet/keplr/), [Cosmostation Browser Extension](../wallet/cosmostation/), [Cosmostation app](../wallet/cosmostation-app/cosmostation-app-deposit-and-send-likecoin.md) or [Liker Land app](../../user-guide/liker-land/download.md). spend LikeCoin or credit card to [collect NFT](collect-writing-nft.md).

Users can also [purchase Writing NFT with a credit card](collect-writing-nft.md) first, and receive the NFT after installing the Keplr wallet.

### How to list Writing NFT for sale?

Writers can publish their works as NFTs via any platform supporting LikeCoin Writing NFT, such as WordPress website. The published NFTs are listed automatically and can be collected via NFT Widget and NFT Portfolio, with no additional work.

### On what basis the price of Writing NFT changes?

[The price changes dynamically based on supply and demand of the NFT](dynamic-pricing.md). Writers do not need to set the price and quantity. Readers do not need to set the bidding price too, just collect when the price feels right. The marked price will decrease when someone sell in secondary market.

### How to install NFT Widget?

You can install the [LikeCoin WordPress plugin](../../user-guide/wordpress.md), and each post will automatically add an NFT Widget. You can also post on writing platforms that support NFT Widget. Users who have technical background can add the iframe of NFT Widget to any webpage.

### I do not have Liker ID, can I buy or sell Writing NFT?

Yes. Readers can buy Writing NFT, writers can mint and hence list NFT for sale, as long as they have enough LikeCoin in their Keplr wallet or use their credit card. Liker ID is not needed.

### How to sell Writing NFT in secondary market?

### How to set the quantity for sale?

There is no upper limit in principle. However, as the marked price will increase automatically as sales goes on, the minting of NFT will stop automatically when the price reaches a point that is out of market’s expectation.

### How to transfer NFT?
