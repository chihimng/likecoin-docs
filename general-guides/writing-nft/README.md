## FAQ

### What is Writing NFT?

A "Writing NFT" is a non-fungible token (NFT) representing a written work, such as an article or any other type of text, with or without accompanying illustrations. In other words, it is digital evidence of the ownership of a piece of written content.

### How to collect Writing NFT？

There are several ways to collect a Writing NFT:

1. Look for an [NFT Widget](collect-writing-nft/nft-widget.md) that is embedded in the content you're interested in.
2. Visit the [Portfolio](collect-writing-nft/nft-portfolio.md) page of the author or collector and purchase the Writing NFT there.
3. Check out the Liker Land NFT marketplace, where Writing NFTs are also available.

To buy a Writing NFT, you can [use a credit card](collect-writing-nft/) and receive the NFT after installing the [Keplr](http://localhost:5000/s/-LL4mdaVjNgL6A1--PV0-1995411665/general-guides/trade/buy-likecoin) wallet. Alternatively, you can also purchase a Writing NFT with LikeCoin.

### Where can I check out my NFT collection?

At the [My Dashboard](dashboard.md) page.

### How to know that there are new NFTs for sale?

Use the [Follow Creators](follow-creators.md) function.

### On what basis does the price of Writing NFT change?

[The price changes dynamically based on supply and demand of the NFT](dynamic-pricing.md). Creators do not need to set the price and quantity. Readers do not need to set the bidding price too, just collect when the price feels right. The market price will decrease when someone sells in the [NFT Marketplace](collect-writing-nft/nft-marketplace.md).

### How to transfer NFT?

[Transfer](transfer-writing-nft.md) can be done at the NFT page, just enter the wallet address of the receiver to transfer.

### How to list Writing NFT for sale?

Creators can publish their works as NFTs via any platform supporting LikeCoin Writing NFT, such as [WordPress website](../../user-guide/wordpress.md), [Liker.Social](https://liker.social/) or [illustBuy](https://illustbuy.com/). The published NFTs are listed automatically and can be collected via [NFT Widget](collect-writing-nft/nft-widget.md) and [NFT Portfolio](collect-writing-nft/nft-portfolio.md), with no additional work.

### I do not have a Liker ID, can I buy Writing NFT?

Yes. Readers can buy Writing NFT with credit card or LikeCoin without registering a Liker ID.

### I do not have a Liker ID, can I sell Writing NFT?

Sure. The [Web3Press plugin](../../user-guide/wordpress.md) supports [NFT Widgets](collect-writing-nft/nft-widget.md) with Keplr wallet address. You can also login your wallet to the[ NFT Portal](../../developer/likenft/nft-portal/) to mint NFT, and then display your work on the [NFT Portfolio](collect-writing-nft/nft-portfolio.md), and share the link for readers to purchase.

### How to install NFT Widget?

You can install the LikeCoin [Web3Press plugin](../../user-guide/wordpress.md), and each post will automatically add an [NFT Widget](collect-writing-nft/nft-widget.md). You can also post on writing platforms that support NFT Widget. Users who have technical background can add the iframe of NFT Widget to any webpage.

### Any other way to sell my Writing NFT besides by NFT Widget?

Yes, you can always share the link of your NFT which can be copied from the [NFT Portfolio](collect-writing-nft/nft-portfolio.md) page or the [NFT Marketplace.](collect-writing-nft/nft-marketplace.md)

### How to sell Writing NFT in the secondary market?

Set the selling price of NFT in the [NFT Marketplace](collect-writing-nft/nft-marketplace.md), and readers can collect it directly.

### How to set the quantity for sale?

There is no upper limit in principle. However, as the marked price will increase automatically as sales goes on, the minting of NFT will stop automatically when the price reaches a point that is out of market’s expectation.
