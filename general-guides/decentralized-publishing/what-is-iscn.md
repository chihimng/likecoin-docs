# What is ISCN

ISCN ([International Standard Content Number](https://iscn.io/)) is the unique metadata record of a piece of content registered on the LikeCoin chain.&#x20;

The use case of ISCN is similar to that of ISBN (International Standard Book Number) for books being published. The process of publishing content to the [LikeCoin chain](https://www.mintscan.io/likecoin) is more or less the same: a unique ISCN is generated for each piece of content and bears corresponding metadata such as authors, publication date, copyright licenses, and the digital fingerprint. ISCN data is immutable due to blockchain's characteristics.

The ISCN data structure supports content versioning, and each ISCN record will connect to its previous version.

Registering an ISCN costs [LikeCoin](https://like.co/), which includes the GAS fee and the cost for the application service provider.
