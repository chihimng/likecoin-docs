# What type of content is supported by ISCN?

ISCN defines the "content metadata" field which allows the user to construct their own data format. It supports any kind of content format including but not limited to articles, photos, videos, music, etc. However, we encourage users to follow the public standard of [schema.org](http://schema.org/) for content metadata.
