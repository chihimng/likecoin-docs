# Delegate on mobile

## Delegate LikeCoin via dao.like.co on a mobile browser

Using a mobile browser with [dao.like.co](https://dao.like.co/) can delegate by [Authcore](../../../user-guide/liker-id/register/), and the steps are the same as [using a desktop computer to delegate LikeCoin via dao.like.co](delegate-on-desktop.md#delegate-via-dao.like.co).

### Step 1: Select a validator&#xD;

Open the [Liker Land app](../../../user-guide/liker-land/download.md) and click "My Wallet" to enter the wallet page. On this page, you can check the amount of LikeCoin you have and see a list of validators below. Select one of them as you like.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/delegate 1-en.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click "My Wallet"</p></figcaption></figure>



<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/delegate 2-en.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Scroll down to see other validators</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/delegate 3-en.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click "All validators" to check out all validators</p></figcaption></figure>

Please note that the commission rate of each validator may not be the same.



Select a validator and bring up the page below, which lists the percentage of rewards, voting power, and how much LikeCoin is being delegated to this validator (Liker Share).

Click "Delegate" and go to the next page.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/delegate 4-en.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click "Delegate"</p></figcaption></figure>

### **Step 2: Enter the amount of LikeCoin to delegate**

Click "Delegate" to bring up the following page, enter the amount of LikeCoin that you would like to delegate to the validator, then click "Next".

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/delegate 5-en.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Enter the amount of LikeCoin to delegate and click "Next"</p></figcaption></figure>

The confirmation page is displayed, showing the validator's wallet address. Click "Details" to reconfirm the amount to delegate and check the estimated [transaction fee](../../wallet/transaction-fee.md).

Click "Confirm", and after a few seconds, it displays "Transaction Completed," which means delegation of LikeCoin is completed.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/delegate 6-en.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click "Confirm" to complete the delegation</p></figcaption></figure>

A validator with your delegation will be displayed as green.

### **Step 3: Relax and Withdraw Rewards!**

Going back to the wallet page, you can drag down the screen and refresh the wallet status.

The LikeCoin rewards earned from delegation will be released every 5 or 6 seconds, quicker than monthly interest from the bank! You can check out the "Delegating Rewards" amount from the validator page or click "Withdraw Rewards" to save the rewards back to your wallet. The minimum withdrawal amount on the Liker Land app is 1 LikeCoin.
