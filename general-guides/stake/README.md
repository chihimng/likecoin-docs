# Stake

By staking your LikeCoin, you will earn additional rewards, similar to receiving interest from putting money in a bank account. However, it's important to note that staking is not the same as taking out a loan or receiving interest on a deposit. You are also giving the voting power to the validator that you stake, and you can cast your own vote for proposals. You can learn how to:

* [Delegate LikeCoin](delegation-of-likecoin.md)
* [Undelegate LikeCoin](undelegation-of-likecoin.md)
* [Redelegate LikeCoin](redelegation-of-likecoin.md)
