# Delegation of LikeCoin

Delegation / Stake means delegating LikeCoin to one or more [validators](../governance/what-is-a-validator/) to earn rewards. Likers who delegate LikeCoin to validators can directly vote for proposals, or let the validators to represent you to raise proposals and vote for or against the proposals when you don't have time to handle. Delegation demonstrates [liquid democracy](../governance/liquid-democracy.md) and is vital to the autonomy for the LikeCoin DAO.

There are several ways to stake LikeCoin, we suggest using [dao.like.co](delegation-of-likecoin.md#delegate-via-dao.like.co) together with [Keplr Browser Extension](../wallet/keplr/), [Cosmostation Browser Extension](../wallet/cosmostation/) or [Authcore](../../user-guide/liker-id/register/) to delegate.

You can delegate directly with [Leap Browser Extension](delegation-of-likecoin.md#delegate-via-leap-browser-extension).

You may also use your mobile to delegate:

* [Cosmostation app](delegation-of-likecoin.md#delegate-via-cosmostation-app)
* [Liker Land app](delegation-of-likecoin.md#delegate-via-liker-land)

&#x20;You may also want to manage your LikeCoin with [Keplr Browser Extension](../wallet/keplr/) and:

* BitSong: [https://wallet.bitsong.io/](https://wallet.bitsong.io/)
