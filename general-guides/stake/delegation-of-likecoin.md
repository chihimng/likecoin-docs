# Delegation of LikeCoin

Delegation / Staking means delegating LikeCoin to one or more [validators](../governance/what-is-a-validator/) to earn rewards. Likers who delegate LikeCoin to validators can directly vote for proposals or let the validators represent them to raise proposals and vote for or against them when they don't have time to handle it. Delegation demonstrates [liquid democracy](../governance/liquid-democracy.md) and is vital to the autonomy of the LikeCoin DAO.

{% endcontent-ref %}

There are several ways to stake LikeCoin. We suggest using [dao.like.co](delegation-of-likecoin.md#delegate-via-dao.like.co) together with [Keplr Browser Extension](../wallet/keplr/), [Cosmostation Browser Extension](../wallet/cosmostation/) or [Authcore](../../user-guide/liker-id/register/) to delegate.

You can also delegate directly with [Leap Browser Extension](delegation-of-likecoin.md#delegate-via-leap-browser-extension).

Additionally, you may also use your mobile to delegate:

* [Cosmostation app](delegation-of-likecoin.md#delegate-via-cosmostation-app)
* [Liker Land app](delegation-of-likecoin.md#delegate-via-liker-land)

&#x20;You may also want to manage your LikeCoin with [Keplr Browser Extension](../wallet/keplr/) and:

* Omniflix - [https://likecoin.omniflix.co/](https://likecoin.omniflix.co/)
* BitSong - [https://wallet.bitsong.io/](https://wallet.bitsong.io/)&#x20;
* ping.pub - [https://ping.pub/](https://ping.pub/)
* Leapboard - [https://cosmos.leapwallet.io/](https://cosmos.leapwallet.io/)

You can also use the Liker Land app to stake LikeCoin. You may check out the tutorial clip and the step-by-step instructions below.

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/nxSy-kEMy0Q" %}

### Step 1: Select a validator&#xD;

Open the [Liker Land app](../../user-guide/liker-land/download.md) and click "My Wallet" to enter the wallet page. On this page, you can check the amount of LikeCoin you have and see a list of validators below. Select one of them as you like.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/delegate 1-en.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click "My Wallet"</p></figcaption></figure>



<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/delegate 2-en.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Scroll down to see other validators</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/delegate 3-en.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click "All validators" to check out all validators</p></figcaption></figure>

Please note that the commission rate of each validator may not be the same.



Select a validator and bring up the page below, which lists the percentage of rewards, voting power, and how much LikeCoin is being delegated to this validator (Liker Share).

Click "Delegate" and go to the next page.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/delegate 4-en.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click "Delegate"</p></figcaption></figure>

### **Step 2: Enter the amount of LikeCoin to delegate**

Click "Delegate" to bring up the following page, enter the amount of LikeCoin that you would like to delegate to the validator, then click "Next".

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/delegate 5-en.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Enter the amount of LikeCoin to delegate and click "Next"</p></figcaption></figure>

The confirmation page is displayed, showing the validator's wallet address. Click "Details" to reconfirm the amount to delegate and check the estimated [transaction fee](../wallet/transaction-fee.md).

Click "Confirm", and after a few seconds, it displays "Transaction Completed," which means delegation of LikeCoin is completed.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/delegate 6-en.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click "Confirm" to complete the delegation</p></figcaption></figure>

A validator with your delegation will be displayed as green.

### **Step 3: Relax and Withdraw Rewards!**

Going back to the wallet page, you can drag down the screen and refresh the wallet status.

The LikeCoin rewards earned from delegation will be released every 5 or 6 seconds, quicker than monthly interest from the bank! You can check out the "Delegating Rewards" amount from the validator page or click "Withdraw Rewards" to save the rewards back to your wallet. The minimum withdrawal amount on the Liker Land app is 1 LikeCoin.
