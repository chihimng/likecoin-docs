# Undelegation of LikeCoin

## Important note **regarding Undelegation**

Once you've confirmed your undelegation, the following happens:

1. It will take a 21-day cooling-off period for your LikeCoin to be returned to your wallet, during which time the LikeCoin cannot be redelegated, rewarded, or transferred.
2. Validator lost his/her voting power of the amount the LikeCoin withdrew.

{% hint style="success" %}
A [transaction fee](../wallet/transaction-fee.md) is required to undelegate LikeCoin
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you find that the amount of LikeCoin you undelegated is less than what you initially delegated, it may be because your validator was penalized for [failing to validate transactions properly](../../user-guide/background.md#9e68). It's important to choose your validator wisely to avoid this situation.
