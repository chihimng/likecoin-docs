## **Attention regarding Undelegation**

Once you've confirmed your undelegation, the following happens:

1. It takes 21 days cooling-off period to undelegate and get back the LikeCoin to your own wallet, the LikeCoin cannot be redelegated, rewarded or transferred as well.
2. Validator lost his/her voting power of the amount the LikeCoin withdrew.

{% hint style="warning" %}
[Transaction fee](../wallet/transaction-fee.md) is required for â€ŒUndelegate LikeCoin.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you find that your LikeCoin undelegated was less than what you delegated to the validator, it may be the case that your validator [cannot validate the transaction properly](../../user-guide/background.md#9e68) and was penalized. Therefore, please choose your validator wisely.
