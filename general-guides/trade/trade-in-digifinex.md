DigiFinex is a top 20+ exchange in CoinMarketCap, trade and exchange volume are on top level, providing LIKE/USDT trading pairs. If you do not have a DigiFinex account, please take a look at [this](registering-on-digifinex.md). Moreover, you have to download the [Keplr](../wallet/keplr/) wallet or [Liker Land app](https://liker.land/getapp) to send/receive LikeCoin. The following instructions are based on DigiFinex web, you may also use [DigiFinex app](https://digifinex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000603862-How-to-download-APP) to trade LikeCoin.

### Step 1: Create your LikeCoin wallet on DigiFinex

First of all you have to create your wallet address on DigiFinex so as to transfer LikeCoin to the exchange. Click on the top right hand corner avatar icon and click "User Center", then click "My Balance". On the search box, input "Like", then click "Deposit"

This action brings you to the page "LikeCoin (LIKE) Deposit", click "Generate deposit address". You can also check your "Deposit History" underneath

![](../../.gitbook/assets/digifinex-14-en.png)

The address that starts with cosmos is your DigiFinex LikeCoin wallet just created, click on the "Show QR Code" so that you don't have to input the cosmos address manually. **Tag/Memo is very important** because it is mandatory for DigiFinex to identify your deposit

Click on the "Show QR Code" button to show your LikeCoin wallet QR Code.

![Click the QR Code icon circled in red to open camera](../../.gitbook/assets/bitasset-trade-7.png)

Input the Tag/Memo number into the "Input memo (optional)" field (**Very Important!**)

Input the amount of LikeCoin that you want to transfer, then click \[Confirm]

![](../../.gitbook/assets/bitasset-trade-8.png)

Next step is to wait for DigiFinex to confirm the transfer.

If you are using [Keplr](../wallet/keplr/), please insert the memo in "Memo (Optional)" field.

![](broken-reference)

{% hint style="danger" %}
DigiFinex requires you to input your "Tag/Memo" into the chain during deposit. If you do not fill in the "Tag/Memo" will result in not being able to deposit into DigiFinex. They will have to find a technician to assist you and require 7-21 days to fix it and a 10 USDT service fee. Your DigiFinext account needs to have such an amount of fee.&#x20;Please contact [DigiFinex Customer Service](https://digifinex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000525241--New-User-Guide-How-to-Find-the-Customer-Service) for handling.

### Step 3: Confirm the transfer to DigiFinex

You can check your wallet balance in "My Balance" following Step&#x20;1\.

### Step 4: Buy or Sell&#xD;

On the top left corner of DigiFinex website there are "Market" and "Spot" on the menu

![](../../.gitbook/assets/digifinex-17-en.png)

Click "Market", on the search box input "Like" will show the chart (As LikeCoin is just into the market, there is no line graph at the moment)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/digifinex-18-en.png)

Click "Spot", input "Like" to the search box on the left, click LIKE/USDT and goes into the exchange panel

![](../../.gitbook/assets/digifinex-19-en.png)

![LIKE/USDT panel](../../.gitbook/assets/digifinex-likeusdt-en.png)

Take a look at the order book on the right hand side. The figures in red are those orders who want to "Sell", for example below there are people who want to sell 424.57 LikeCoin at the price of 0.007200 USDT/LIKE, and then some other people want to sell 417.44 LikeCoin at 0.007300 USDT/LIKE. If you want to buy 500 LikeCoin, you can buy them all at 0.007300 USDT/LIKE

If you want to sell your LikeCoin, you have to monitor the seller in green. For example below if you want to sell 100 LikeCoin, it is guaranteed to be sold at 0.006600 USDT/LIKE because the highest selling price is 0.006600 to buy 151.07 LikeCoin

To make it simple, if you want to sell, check out the orders in green; if you want to buy, check out the orders in red. You can also take a look at the "Latest" transaction statistic

![](../../.gitbook/assets/digifinex-20-en.png)

Once you decide the price and amount to buy or sell, go to the "Spot" to confirm. Let use "Limit Price" as an example

You have to input 3 parameters:

* Select the right action for "Buy LIKE" or "Sell LIKE
* Input "Price": using the order book above as an example, fill in 0.006600 for selling LikeCoin
* Input "Amount": Fill in 200 for selling 200 LikeCoin, or adjust the percentage e.g. 100%, 50%, etc

![](../../.gitbook/assets/digifinex-21-en.png)

The system will calculate "Total", confirm if they are correct or not, then click "Sell LIKE" to complete the transaction.&#x20;
