# Proposal Deposit

Since the [FoTan](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/Qmb7AYNsbRJ95dWXCYCkUbpypAVfuxMZwB1D8wFHfwrLyc/) upgrade, likers can directly deposit the likecoin required to click start proposal voting.&#x20;

Any validator can raise a proposal. In order to have a proposal to enter the voting period, 100k LikeCoin has to be deposited within 2 weeks. The deposit may come from other validators and Likers.

In case the proposal fails to get 100k LikeCoin deposit in 2-week time, the proposal will be abandoned and the deposit will be forfeit and go to the Community Pool. The usage of the pool is determined by further proposals.

Please note, if the proposal fails to achieve quorum, or gets more than 1/3 voting power as veto, then the proposal will be turned down and the deposited LikeCoin will be expropriated to the Community Pool; else the deposit will be transferred back to the owners.

There are multiple ways to deposit for a proposal, we suggest using [dao.like.co](https://dao.like.co/welcome) together with [Keplr Browser Extension](../wallet/keplr/), [Cosmostation Browser Extension](../wallet/cosmostation/) or [Authcore](../../user-guide/liker-id/register/) .

* BitSong: [https://wallet.bitsong.io/](https://wallet.bitsong.io/)
