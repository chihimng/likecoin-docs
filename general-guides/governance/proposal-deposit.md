# Proposal Deposit

Since the [FoTan](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/Qmb7AYNsbRJ95dWXCYCkUbpypAVfuxMZwB1D8wFHfwrLyc/) upgrade, Likers can now deposit the required [LikeCoin](https://like.co/) directly to start proposal voting.

Any validator can raise a proposal, but to enter the voting period, a deposit of 100k LikeCoin must be made within two weeks. The deposit may come from other validators or Likers.

If the proposal fails to get 100k LikeCoin within the two-week time frame, it will be abandoned and the deposit will be forfeited and added to the Community Pool. The usage of the pool will be determined by further proposals.

Please note that if the proposal fails to achieve quorum or receives more than one-third of the voting power as veto, the proposal will be rejected and the deposited LikeCoin will be expropriated to the Community Pool. If the proposal is successful, the deposit will be returned to the owners.

There are several ways to deposit for a proposal, but we suggest using [dao.like.co](https://dao.like.co/welcome) n conjunction with the [Keplr Browser Extension](../wallet/keplr/), [Cosmostation Browser Extension](../wallet/cosmostation/) or [Authcore](../../user-guide/liker-id/register/).
