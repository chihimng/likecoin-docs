# Governance

Not only is LikeCoin token a reward to creators and Content Jockeys, it also serves doubly as the governing token for the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), namely, the LikeCoin DAO.

Likers participate in liquid democracy by delegating their LikeCoin tokens to validators they trust, and freely switch among them without a fixed term of office. Issues such as community expenses, inflation rate and protocol updates require passing a corresponding proposal by the DAO
