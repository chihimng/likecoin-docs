# Direct Voting

Since the [FoTan](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/Qmb7AYNsbRJ95dWXCYCkUbpypAVfuxMZwB1D8wFHfwrLyc/) upgrade, likers who have delegated LikeCoin to validators can now directly vote on proposals.

In addition to delegating your voting powers to validators to let them vote on your behalf, you can now vote by yourself. For example, if your validator votes "No," you can vote "Yes" based on the stake that you have. But if you do not cast your vote, your trusted validator will still represent you in the vote.&#x20;

There are multiple ways to vote for a proposal, **we suggest using** [**dao.like.co**](direct-vote.md#vote-via-dao.like.co) together with [Keplr Browser Extension](../wallet/keplr/), [Cosmostation Browser Extension](../wallet/cosmostation/) or [Authcore](../../user-guide/liker-id/register/).&#x20;

You can also vote directly with [Leap Browser Extension](direct-vote.md#delegate-via-leap-browser-extension).

#### You may also want to vote with web dashboard:&#x20;
