# Validator

## Bank + Senator

A validator on the LikeCoin chain functions as both a bank and a senator within the LikeCoin DAO.

They operate a set of servers 24/7 to validate all transactions made by Likers, including token transfers, content publishing, and voting.

### Validating Transaction (Bank)

In order to achieve consensus within a community, some trusted parties need to record all transactions. In the traditional world, this is done by banks, which charge various fees. However, in Liker Land, peer-to-peer transactions generally take only 5 seconds and incur extremely low costs.

### Raising a proposal and Vote (Senator)

Liker endorsement is reflected through delegation. When a Liker delegates their LikeCoin to a validator, they are trusting the validator's technical ability, knowledge, and integrity, and allowing the validator to represent them

## Validator Status

### Active Validator

An active validator is one that performs its duty of [validating transactions](../../../user-guide/background.md#9e68) and has the most delegated LikeCoin within the active validator numbers as governed by the constitution.



### Inactive Validator



An inactive validator is a validator that does not perform its duty or has been "jailed," or a validator that does not have sufficient LikeCoin delegation and is outnumbered by the active validators as governed by the constitution.
