# Keplr: Deposit and Send LikeCoin

## **Deposit your LikeCoin to Keplr**

### Step 1

Before depositing LikeCoin to your Keplr wallet, please change the display on top to show the LikeCoin chain.

### Step 2

Scan the QR code and deposit LikeCoin to your Keplr wallet with LIKE pay. We suggest depositing a small sum to try out first.

### Step 3

The LikeCoin balance will appear (on the same screen as Step 2) after the deposit is completed.

## **Send LikeCoin from Keplr to another wallet**

### Step 1

You can send LikeCoin via Keplr to another wallet that supports LikeCoin. Change the display on top to show the LikeCoin chain and click "Send".

### Step 2

Fill in the wallet address of the recipient under "Recipient", and the token will be selected automatically as LIKE. The "Amount" field shows the available balance of LIKE in the wallet. Please enter the amount of LikeCoin that needs to be sent and reserve some LIKE for the [transaction fee](../transaction-fee.md). Under "Memo" (optional), fill in the tag/memo that may be required by the recipient. Then click "Send".

The transaction is complete. Keplr will show that the Tx is pending and return to the LikeCoin balance screen.
