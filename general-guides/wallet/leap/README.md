# Leap Browser Extension Wallet

Note that Leap does not support the registration of Liker ID yet.

## Leap Mobile Wallet

Leap also launched a mobile wallet, which has the same function as the Leap Browser Extension. Since it is still in the trial stage, please refer to the [Leap official website](https://www.leapwallet.io/) for more details.

## Leapboard

[Leapboard](https://cosmos.leapwallet.io/) is the wallet interface of Leap. Users can use the [Leap Browser extension](./), [Keplr Browser extension](../keplr/) or [Cosmostation Browser extension](../cosmostation/) to log in and transfer, delegate, and vote. You can also use their Telegram notification function to monitor LikeCoin transactions in your wallet at any time.
