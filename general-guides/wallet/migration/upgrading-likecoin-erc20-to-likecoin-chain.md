# Upgrade LikeCoin ERC-20 to LikeCoin chain

LikeCoin has been migrated to the Cosmos ecosystem [LikeCoin chain](../../governance/likecoin-chain.md) from ERC-20 and users no longer need MetaMask wallet to login but should use [Liker Land app](../../../user-guide/liker-land/download.md) or [Keplr](../keplr/) instead.  This document is for legacy users who created Liker ID with MetaMask and did not complete the Liker ID migration process only.

Please note all upgrade procedures has to be done on desktop computer, not supporting mobile.

## Liker ID bond with MetaMask and Social Accounts

For those who fulfil the below conditions:

1. Can still login the MetaMask wallet bond with the Liker ID
2. Your Liker ID bond with MetaMask and at least one social accounts ( Google/Facebook/Twitter/Matters ) besides MetaMask
3. Have ETH on MetaMask as Gas Fee

Please follow the steps and upgrade from LikeCoin ERC-20 to LikeCoin chain.

### Step 1: Login MetaMask

Login the MetaMask wallet that bonds with your Liker ID, if you have change your computer, please use your [Secret Recovery Phrase](https://community.metamask.io/t/what-is-a-secret-recovery-phrase-and-how-to-keep-your-crypto-wallet-secure/3440) or private key to establish your MetaMask wallet again.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please note if you cannot manage the MetaMask wallet bond with your Liker, you are not able to upgrade and access the LikeCoin in your wallet.

Moreover, using the MetaMask wallet that does not bond with the Liker ID cannot upgrade as well, which means, you cannot use the same Liker ID in the new LikeCoin chain.

Keep the Secret Recovery Phrase or private key is the responsibility of the user, no one can reset your MetaMask wallet unless yourself.

## If you purchased your LikeCoin in a crypto exchange

Transfer your LikeCoin to a MetaMask wallet, then go to [https://migration.like.co/](https://migration.like.co/) and fill in the Cosmos wallet address of the Liker ID or Keplr wallet and facilitate the upgrade.

## If your LikeCoin is stored in a hardware wallet

Connect the hardware wallet with MetaMask, go to [https://migration.like.co/](https://migration.like.co/) and fill in the Cosmos wallet address of the Liker ID or Keplr wallet and facilitate the upgrade.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not use and directly input the crypto exchange Cosmos wallet address into [https://migration.like.co/](https://migration.like.co/). If that particular exchange required Tag/Memo or other operations, you will not be able to deposit your LikeCoin. Therefore please migratie the LikeCoin to your own wallet before performing other trades or operations.

**Do not directly send your LikeCoin to the smart contract address.** You really have to use   [https://migration.like.co/](https://migration.like.co/) to facilitate migration.

Wrongly operated the LikeCoin ERC-20 migration will result in irreversible failure**.**
