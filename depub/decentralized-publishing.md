# Decentralized Publishing

Decentralized Publishing ( Depub ) is to publish content such as articles, photo, books, video to the blockchain, so that they can last forever.

Decentralized Publishing's features include:

* No prerequisite
* Openness and Transparency
* Low Barrier

LikeCoin is a Decentralized Publishing Infrastructure.  Content metadata will be registered in the LikeCoin public blockchain as [ISCN](what-is-iscn/), International Standard Content Number, and link to decentralized storage solution like the [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) or [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) for storing and serving ISCN-linked content.
