# Publish NFT eBook

{% hint style="info" %}
Publish NFT requires the [Keplr Browser Extension](../../general-guides/wallet/keplr/) and [LikeCoin](https://like.co/) on a desktop computer
{% endhint %}

Publishing an NFT eBook on the blockchain involves the following processes:

1. [Prepare the ePub File](./#create-an-epub-file-and-enter-metadata)
2. [Register ISCN](./#register-iscn)
3. [List the Book for Sale](./#list-the-book-for-sale)

***

## Create an epub file and enter metadata

Create an [ePub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) file and enter [metadata](../what-is-iscn/). First, create the ePub file for the e-book, and ensure that the metadata has been entered and organized. Metadata includes book title, author, cover image, publication date, description, etc. Taking the commonly used ePub editing software as an example:

#### calibre

In [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/), the "Edit Metadata" button is in the upper left corner of the screen. After organizing the metadata, click "Save to disk".

#### Sigil

In [Sigil](https://sigil-ebook.com/), you can press the F8 key to edit metadata on the fly.

## Register ISCN

After preparing the ePub file, register it as an ISCN.

### Step 1: Upload the file

Visit the[ app.like.co](https://app.like.co/) website and click "Register ISCN".

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 5.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Visit the app.like.co website and click "Register ISCN"</p></figcaption></figure>

A pop-up window will appear; click on Keplr to connect the wallet.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 6.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A pop-up window will appear; click on Keplr to connect the wallet</p></figcaption></figure>

Click "Select a file" to upload the prepared ePub file.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 7.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click "Select a file" to upload the prepared ePub file</p></figcaption></figure>

The system will automatically split the ePub file content into two files: one is the ePub file, and the other is the book cover image file. Check if everything is okay, then click "Start Upload". The system will upload these two files to the distributed network.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 8.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click "Start Upload" to upload the two files to the distributed network</p></figcaption></figure>

The Keplr wallet will pop up a window several times; click "Approve" to sign and wait for a while.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 9.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click "Approve" on Keplr to sign</p></figcaption></figure>

### Step 2: Enter book information

"File Ready" appears, indicating that the file has been successfully uploaded. The system will automatically fill in the information based on the metadata content. The user can change them if they want:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 10.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>"File Ready" appears</p></figcaption></figure>

1. Type: The default is "Book" for NFT eBooks.
2. ISCN Title: The title of the book associated with the ISCN.
3. Description: A brief description of the NFT eBook.
4. Author: The author's name.
5. Stakeholders: The system will automatically add the author and the ISCN registrant as stakeholders.
6. Tags: These are used for classification purposes.
7. Downloadable URL: The file's name of the ePub when it is being downloaded.
8. URL: The URL of the ePub.
9. License: The default is "Copyright. All rights reserved" for copyright declaration.
10. Content Fingerprints: These are URL hashes of the book and its cover. Each pair corresponds to one file, including IPFS and AR (Arweave) formats. Click on the URLs to check whether the content has been successfully uploaded. For instance, the four hashes in the attached screenshot represent the IPFS ePub file, IPFS book cover file, AR ePub file, and AR book cover file.
11. \+Other settings: Click on it to fill in the URL and ISBN fields if required.

After confirming that everything is correct, click "Register".

### Step 3: ISCN registration completed

The message "Completed! Here is your ISCN" appears, indicating that the ISCN has been successfully registered. The string of characters in the ISCN ID field will be used when listing the NFT eBook for sale; click to copy it. Note that the '/1' in the picture is the ISCN version number, which is not essential when creating NFT eBooks.

## List the Book for Sale

Listing for sale is divided into two steps: minting the NFT eBook and listing it. An analogy to traditional publishing is printing manuscripts into books and placing them on bookshelves for sale.

### Step 1: Mint the NFT eBook

Visit the [LikeCoin NFT BookPress](https://likecoin.github.io/nft-book-press/) website, click "Mint NFT", enter the website, and click the "Connect Wallet" link in the upper right corner to connect with Keplr.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 16.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Visit the LikeCoin NFT BookPress website, click "Mint NFT"</p></figcaption></figure>

In the "Enter ISCN ID or NFT Class ID" field, input the ISCN ID previously registered on app.like.co, and please note that there is no need to include the ISCN version number. Afterward, click "Submit".

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 17.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>In the "Enter ISCN ID or NFT Class ID" field, enter the ISCN ID</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
If you forget your ISCN ID, you can retrieve it in "[My Works](https://app.like.co/works)" at app.like.co.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The system will automatically extract the basic information of ISCN for you. Fill in other information required in the "By filling required information" tab.

Enter the number of NFTs to mint in the "Number of NFT to mint" field.

If your book file is in ePub format, the system will automatically extract the link to the AR cover and place it in the "Image URL" column.

"External URL (optional)" and "URI (optional)" do not need to be filled in.

After filling in and confirming that everything is correct, click "Mint". The Keplr wallet will pop up windows several times. Click "Approve" to sign.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 18.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Enter all the information and click "Mint"</p></figcaption></figure>

The ðŸŽ‰ Success! screen appears, indicating that the NFT has been successfully minted. Click "Continue to publish NFT Book" to complete the listing. Click "View your NFT" to view minted NFT eBooks in [Liker Land](https://liker.land/).

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 20.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>. Click "Continue to publish NFT Book" to complete the listing. Click "View your NFT" to view minted NFT eBooks in Liker Land</p></figcaption></figure>

Since it is not yet available for sale, you will see the words "Sold Out".

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 21.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Since it is not yet available for sale, you will see the words "Sold Out"</p></figcaption></figure>

### Step 2: Book Listing

Return to LikeCoin NFT BookPress, click "Continue to publish NFT Book", and the NFT Book Store Management Page will appear.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you accidentally closed the page, you can enter your NFT Class ID in [Step 1](./#register-iscn) "Enter ISCN ID or NFT Class ID", and you will see "Continue to publish NFT Book". The Class ID is the string after the URL of your NFT eBook. For example, your NFT URL is  https://liker.land/zh-Hant/nft/class/likenft1qq06n42guzvt087wxunaajvz3alx6wadq6mfz0yz57gffwsrgrasl2m59x, and the NFT Class ID is likenft1qq06n42guzvt087wxunaajvz3alx6wadq6mf z0yz57gffwsrgrasl2m59x.
{% endhint %}

The NFT Class ID and Total number of NFT for sale, which is the number of NFT eBooks that have been minted, automatically appear in the "New NFT Book Listing".

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NFT Book Press 22.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The NFT Class ID and Total number of NFT for sale automatically appear in the "New NFT Book Listing"</p></figcaption></figure>

* Product name of this edition: You can set the version of NFT according to your personal preferences, such as Standard Edition, Free Edition, etc. Click "Add Edition" in the upper right corner to add multiple different versions.
