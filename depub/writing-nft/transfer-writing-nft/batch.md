* Find the [NFT Class ID](../collect-writing-nft/nft-details.md#nft-class-id) on the Writing NFT that will be distributed to supporters.
* Enter the NFT Class ID into the Send NFTs tool, and enter the supportersâ€™ wallet addresses to the "Recipient Address list" and the "Transfer message", then press "Send" and sign in Keplr to batch send NFTs to supporters.
