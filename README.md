### What is LikeCoin?

LikeCoin decentralizes publishing by allowing everyone to publish their content as an NFTs with a suite of open tools. ([NFT portal & widget](https://app.like.co/), [plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/likecoin/), [open APIs](https://api.like.co/))

### Content Ownership

Own your content by publishing an NFT on the LikeCoin chain.

### Decentralize Publishing

LikeCoin envisions a future where digital content is transformed from “Web-native” to “NFT native” format. All content will be natively created on the blockchain and stored in two layers.

**Property right layer** — the metadata registry ISCN (international standard content number) records the relationships between the content and creator.\
\
**The NFT layer** — the proof of ownership and the mechanism of transfer between purchasers and creators.

### Writing NFT

NFT can be an email, an image, an identity, or a book.  **LikeCoin** [**Writing NFT**](general-guides/writing-nft/) is designed especially for text-based content creation.

Similar to the workflow of traditional publishing, i.e., securing content authorship -> printing the content in books -> selling in bookstore, creators can now register the content on the LikeCoin chain -> mint an NFT of it -> sell it in NFT marketplaces. Compared with the constraints in physical publishing, publishing content and exchanging value in the metaverse can be more flexible and everlasting.

### **LikeCoin Mission**

LikeCoin’s mission is to democratize publishing services to ensure everyone has access to affordable, transparent, and efficient publishing services. By writing content immutably to the blockchain, we believe that our censorship-resistant publishing infrastructure is a key to improving the marketplace for content and maintaining freedom of speech.

We believe great software should be easy to use. Creators can focus on what they are good at — creating quality content. All LikeCoin tools such as widgets, WordPress plugins, and APIs are designed to help creators get started easily but also offer powerful features for creators to grow and succeed.

### LikeCoin DAO

[LikeCoin DAO](https://dao.like.co/proposals) is a decentralized organization that allows all LIKE token holders to participate in governance decisions. Every LikeCoin holder is a stakeholder of the DAO.&#x20;

The DAO performs collective decisions of the public treasury, infrastructure for common goods, and evolvement of policies, which can all be evolved via the LikeCoin DAO governance process. Governance decisions include, for example, voting on governance decisions related to the token or other rules impacting the LikeCoin ecosystem. The LikeCoin community uses proposals to decide how to allocate resources from the community fund, rules and procedures for governance, selection of representatives for various working groups (“subdao’s”), etc.

### LIKE token

LIKE is the native token of LikeCoin, a BPoS blockchain built on Cosmos SDK. LIKE is the utility and governance token of the LikeCoin ecosystem.

All transaction fees, network usage, and services built upon LikeCoin infrastructure will use LIKE as the primary token across new projects

LIKE is hyperinflationary, with incentives for staking to secure the LikeCoin chain. There is no fixed total supply of LIKEs and the total supply will increase each year between 7-20% due to inflation. The top 50 validators that have the most staked LIKE will fill the active validator's seats for validating and creating new transactions for the chain. Active validators' seats can be changed by the community through proposals that are voted on by those holding LIKE tokens.

### LikeCoin ecosystem

The [LIKE ecosystem](https://likecoin.bigdipper.live/) is made up of the community of everyday people who hold LIKE and the creators of products and services utilizing LIKE. Currently, this community comprises 60k+ addresses, 8k+ media sites, and 2 mil+ registered pieces of content authored by 26k+ creators in the LikeCoin ecosystem.

Liker Land is one of the core teams in the LikeCoin community and it created the early MVP and Dapps of LikeCoin — including the [LikeCoin button](https://docs.like.co/developer/likecoin-button), [WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/likecoin/), [ISCN app](https://app.like.co/), and the upcoming NFT minting widget that allows creators to mint NFTs directly from their own website.

One of the newest, Dapps in the LikeCoin ecosystem is [depub.space](https://depub.space/). It is a web3-native “decentralized Twitter” where influencers sell ”Follows" and creations as NFTs.&#x20;

### Kickstarted

The first step is to own LikeCoin, and use it for publishing or governance.  You can try to post a decentralized tweet on [depub.space](https://depub.space), vote on [dao.like.co](http://dao.like.co/), or reward any creators by transferring LIKE via Keplr wallet.
