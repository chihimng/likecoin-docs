# How to be a Civic Liker

Before becoming a Civic Liker, please [register a Liker ID](../liker-id/).

Users stake at least **5,000** LIKE to the "Civic Liker node" **with a wallet address bound to a Liker ID** to become a Civic Liker. All delegation rewards from the Civic Liker node will be distributed to creators in the form of LIKE. There is no need to use the delegation principle, and only the delegation rewards can turn likes into income.

Based on the current commission rate of about 15%, the monthly rewards that 5,000 LIKE can generate are equal to 5,000 \* 0.15 / 12 = 62.5 LIKE, which is approximately US$1.5 per month at the current exchange rate. The more you delegate, the more Likes you can turn into actual income.

Please note that there is no "Ranking" system for Civic Liker, and the only effect of delegating more LikeCoin is to reward more to the creators:

* Every clap on the LikeCoin button by a Civic Liker will be equivalent to 1 LikeCoin.
* The stake reward derived from Civic Liker delegation every day will be distributed to the creators according to the principle of 1 clap to the LikeCoin button = 1 LIKE.
  * The unused staking reward can be accumulated until the account balance is used up.

Civic Liker can not only distribute the delegation rewards but also distribute the [Creators Fund](creators-fund.md). The influence of clicking the LikeCoin button on the allocation of funds will vary with the delegation amount. Stake more, reward more, and have greater power to vote in LikeCoin DAO and for Creators Fund distribution.

## Become a Civic Liker by delegating with the Liker Land app

For details, please refer to "[Delegate via Liker Land](../../general-guides/stake/delegation-of-likecoin.md)" and select the Civic Liker node to delegate.

{% hint style="success" %}
Civic Liker will take effect within 24 hours after the delegation is completed.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the user has already delegated to another validator, please [redelegate](../../general-guides/stake/redelegation-of-likecoin.md) instead of undelegate. Otherwise, you will need to wait for a 21-day cooling-off period before you can use the funds again.
