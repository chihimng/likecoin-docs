# Blogging Platforms

## Medium

Before adding the LikeCoin button, please [register a Liker ID](../../liker-id/).

For example, if your Liker ID is "ckxpress", your LikeCoin button link will be https://button.like.co/ckxpress

Then, add the link to the [Medium](https://medium.com/) article, usually at the end of it. Press "enter" to create a carriage return, and the LikeCoin button will appear automatically.
