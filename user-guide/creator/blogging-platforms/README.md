# Blogging Platforms

## Medium

Before adding the LikeCoin button, please [register a Liker ID](../../liker-id/).

For example, if your Liker ID is ckxpress, your LikeCoin button link is https://button.like.co/ckxpress

Then add the link into the [Medium](https://medium.com/) article (usually at the end of it), press "enter" to facilitate a carriage return, the LikeCoin button appears automatically.
