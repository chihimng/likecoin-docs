# Register Liker ID through the general method (with Authcore)

Using the [Liker Land mobile app](https://liker.land/getapp), you can register a Liker ID through the general method (with Authcore). However, this login method will gradually phase out. Users are advised [export their seed words from Authcore](../export-seed-words.md) and import them into Keplr or other wallets to manage their LikeCoin.

## Register a Liker ID through the general method (with Authcore) using the Liker Land app

To register a Liker ID through the general method (with Authcore) using the [Liker Land app](../../liker-land/download.md), follow these instructions:

### Step 1: Start Registering

Open your Liker Land app and click the "Sign Up" button.

### **Step 2: Choose your Sign Up method**

The Liker Land app provides 6 registration options, such as email+password and social logins: Google login, Facebook login, Twitter login, Apple login, and Matters login. We suggest registering with your social media accounts, as it is safer and easier. Click on the social media icon to continue.

### Step 3: Log in to your social media account and authorize the registration

### Step 4: Create your Liker ID

A green page will appear, allowing you to choose your favorite Liker ID. The system will suggest a Liker ID for you, but if you are not satisfied with it, you can change it here. Fill in your Liker ID and click "Confirm" to complete the registration process.

Please note that once the Liker ID and login method have been created, they cannot be changed. If you want to have another Liker ID, please create a new account. Also, **please note that each email address or wallet address can only register one Liker ID.**

**You cannot use the same email address to register a Liker ID with both Authcore and Keplr**
