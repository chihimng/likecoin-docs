# What is Authcore?

[Authcore](https://authcore.io/) is a universal platform for secure and frictionless sign-in. It protects all user accounts with advanced security features and integrates with Intel SGX to reduce the time and internal resources needed to implement a reliable data protection solution.

The user's private key is secured by a key management service. Clients authenticate through SPAKE2 zero-knowledge proofs and the key management service. The key management service also uses strong encryption to protect the data. This design guarantees that only users can access their private key, providing a convenient and cost-effective experience.
