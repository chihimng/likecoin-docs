# WordPress

The current hassle to publish articles as NFTs: Creators needed to find ways to save the contents and metadata on decentralized storage such as IPFS or blockchain, before selling them on the NFT marketplaces. Furthermore, they had to purchase several kinds of cryptocurrencies during the process. We have good news for WordPress users: After finishing your articles, you only need one click to publish pre-NFT credentials to blockchain. the whole process just takes one minute to complete within the WordPress editor!

The brand new [LikeCoin Writing NFT WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/likecoin/) is tailor made for Gutenberg editor, which links up the WordPress website with Web3 by just one click. Its functions include:

* One-click publishing to LikeCoin plus storage at IPFS and Arweave
* On-chain and decentralized storage fees can be paid by LikeCoin in one go
