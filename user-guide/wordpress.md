# Web3Press

The current hassle to publish articles as NFTs: Creators needed to find ways to save the contents and metadata on decentralized storage such as IPFS or blockchain, before selling them on the NFT marketplaces. Furthermore, they had to purchase several kinds of cryptocurrencies during the process. We have good news for WordPress users: After finishing your articles, you only need one click to publish NFT credentials to blockchain. the whole process just takes one minute to complete within the WordPress editor!

The brand new LikeCoin [Web3Press plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/likecoin/) is tailor made for Gutenberg editor, which links up the WordPress website with Web3 by just one click and decentralized publishing can be actualized to the fullest. It's functions include:

* Set the post title and tags as the NFT metadata automatically
* One-click publishing to LikeCoin plus storage at IPFS and Arweave and register [ISCN](../general-guides/decentralized-publishing/what-is-iscn.md).
* On-chain and decentralized storage fees can be paid by LikeCoin in one go
* After minting Writing NFT, a [NFT Widget](../general-guides/writing-nft/collect-writing-nft/nft-widget.md) is automatically embedded at the bottom of each post for readers to [collect Writing NFT](../general-guides/writing-nft/collect-writing-nft/) and Integrate [LikeCoin button](creator/).
* Support [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) auto backups

Readers will get the access of an immutable content copy which is stored in distributed file system after buying an NFT. The copy can be regarded as the “true copy” in Web3.
